This project focuses on building a **multilingual preference model** based on **Cohere 2**, supporting over **20 languages**. The architecture incorporates **sequence classification**, allowing the model to be used both for preference modeling and classification tasks. Fine-tuning was conducted using the **multilingual ORCA DPO dataset**, with optimizations for training efficiency.

## 📌 Project Highlights
- **Multilingual preference modeling**: Built on **Cohere 2**, supporting over **20 languages**  
- **Sequence classification**: Added a classification head for flexible usage in various tasks  
- **Fine-tuning with ORCA DPO dataset**: Improved cross-lingual preference understanding  
- **Optimized training**: Used **LoRA adapters** to reduce computational overhead while maintaining performance  
- **Evaluation**: Achieved **~70% accuracy** on a test set (5% subset of the training data)  

## 🏗️ Model Pipeline
The preference model is used in **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)** training.

## 🧠 Model Architecture
The model is based on **Cohere 2** with an added **sequence classification** head, making it adaptable for both **preference modeling and classification tasks**.

**Promppt Engineering:** The input consists of a prompt + Response A + Response B, then input is passed to model classifying which response is better.
